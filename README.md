## Security Notes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Before deploying to production:

1. **Enable Row Level Security (RLS)**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE enrollments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE reviews ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

2. **Add RLS Policies**
   ```sql
   -- Users can only see their own data
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view own data" ON users
     FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
   
   -- Users can only see their own enrollments
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view own enrollments" ON enrollments
     FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

3. **Enable email confirmation** in Supabase Auth settings

4. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data (not hardcoded in config.js)
